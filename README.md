## About

Kidz Kitchen was created with love. My son in very much into cooking and this was a request straight from him. This app is built with the thought that kids can have a place to keep track of there recipes and also gain inspiration from the generate recipe feature found in the recipe dropdown. This feature is querying a third party API called recipepuppy.

All the authentication steps i.e. sign-up, sign-in, change password will have forms that pop up when the appropriate uri is visited.
When a user successfully signs-up they will be redirected to the profile screen to create their profile. After this that screen will no longer be accessible as a user can not create more than one profile.
The Main screen for the user after the sign-up and profile setup process will be their profile information displayed on the screen. There will be a navigation bar at the top for settings (to change password, and alter profile settings) and a recipes link(to crud recipes)

## Planning and Problem Solving

For this project I relied heavily on my prior knowledge throughout the course. I used what I learned in past projects to better prep and complete features I wanted. I fully thought out the app and styles I wanted and also pre planned some of the code to make the development time faster.

## Unsolved / Future Features

In the future versions of this app I would like to have a profile for each user to set an about me, favorite cuisine, and name. I would also like to include images for food. 

## V2 / stretch goals
